# Swagger: http://swagger.io/docs/specification/what-is-swagger/

# NOTE: Swagger is optional. Alternatively you can just copy paste json
# examples in a markdown file and add some documentation.

# TODO: Also flow could be used for request validation and document generation
# instead of swagger?

# NOTE: Concentrate especially on defining request parameters and response codes
# (OK, not found, ...). Describing response content is not that important,
# since api user can browse the returned response himself.

# TODO Create swagger definitions with some tool that supports generating
#   Swagger definitions from json? API2Swagger?
# TODO Use Swagger for request validation?
# TODO Deploy swagger-ui: helps developers, testers, etc. Supports calling
#   real APIs?
