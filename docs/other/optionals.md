# Optional stack components

## Admin

The `admin` directory contains a template for an admin GUI based on [react-admin](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin).

Browse [demo](https://marmelab.com/react-admin-demo/) for some ideas.

## Shared

The `shared` directory is available for all Docker containers. You can use it for shared code (e.g. linked npm libraries that are used both in client and server).

## Static site generation

This template can be found under `www`.

### Configuration

Configure static site generator of your choice with the following instructions. Currently instructions are provided only for Gatsby, Hugo, Jekyll and plain static files, but with some extra work the full-stack-template may easily be used with any static site generator.

Remove static site generators that you do not use from `www/install.sh` but do not delete the whole file:

    EDIT www/install.sh

Build and start containers (see `taito trouble` if containers fail to start):

    taito stop
    taito start --clean

Once you see text `No site yet at www/site. Just keep the container running.`, execute the following steps depending on the static site generator of your choice.

### Plain static files (no site generator)

1. Add your static files to www/public with your code editor.

2. Restart containers and open the site on browser:

   ```
   taito stop
   taito start --clean
   taito open www
   ```

### Gatsby

1. Start a shell inside the www Docker container:

   ```
   taito shell:www
   ```

2. Create a new Gatsby site based on one of the [starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters?v=2) (NOTE: Select 'npm' as package manager and ignore the 'git commit' error):

   ```
   su node
   npx gatsby new site STARTER-SOURCE-URL-OF-MY-CHOICE
   rm -rf site/.git
   exit
   exit
   ```

3. Add development start command for docker to `www/site/package.json`:

   ```
   "start:docker": "gatsby develop --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080",
   ```

4. Enable `/service/site/node_modules` mount in `docker-compose.yaml`:

   ```
   EDIT docker-compose.yaml
   ```

5. Restart containers and open the site on browser:

   ```
   taito stop
   taito start --clean
   taito open www
   ```

### Hugo

1. Start a shell inside the www Docker container:

   ```
   taito shell:www
   ```

2. Create a new Hugo site (See [Hugo themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) and [Hugo quick start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) for more details):

   ```
   hugo new site site
   cd site
   git clone https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
   rm -rf themes/ananke/.git
   echo 'theme = "ananke"' >> config.toml
   hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
   exit
   ```

3. If you have some trouble with links, you might also need to enable relative urls by using the following settings in `www/site/config.toml`:

   ```
   baseURL = ""
   relativeURLs = true
   ```

4. Restart containers and open the site on browser:

   ```
   taito stop
   taito start --clean
   taito open www
   ```

### Jekyll

1. Start a shell inside the www Docker container:

   ```
   taito shell:www
   ```

2. Create a new site:

   ```
   bash
   jekyll new site
   exit
   exit
   ```

3. Restart containers and open the site on browser:

   ```
   taito stop
   taito start --clean
   taito open www
   ```

### Static API docs generation with Gate

This template can be found under `www/site`.

Gate generates pretty and well structured API documentation.

Heavily inspired by [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate), and hence by [Stripes](https://stripe.com/docs/api) API docs.
You can use the same markdown files as in slate.

#### Features

- **Clean and simple design**

- **Single Page Layout**

- **Markdown source**

- **Syntax highlighting**

#### Get started

#### Prerequisites

What you need:

- **[GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org)**
- **Node**

#### Set Up

1. Fork this repository on GitHub.
2. Clone _your forked repository_ (not our original one) to your hard drive with `git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/gate.git`
3. `cd gate`
4. Start Gate: `gatsby develop`

Your docs are now available at http://localhost:8000. Easy.

#### Limitations / Issues

Syntax Highlighting: Currently only `bash` is processed by prismjs.
`shell` or `curl` don't work.
